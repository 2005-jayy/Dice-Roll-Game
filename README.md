# 🎲 Dice Game

This is a basic dice game project I built while learning JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## 💡 Features:

- Rolling a dice with random number generation
- Switching active players dynamically
- Score tracking and winner detection
- Reset functionality to start a new game

## 🧠 What I Learned:

- Working with `querySelector`, `getElementById`, and `classList`
- Event handling using `addEventListener`
- Updating the DOM dynamically using JavaScript
- Writing clean, modular code (e.g., `switchPlayer()` function)

## 🛠️ Tech Used:

- HTML
